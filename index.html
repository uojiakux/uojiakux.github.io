        Hello Everyone! Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Ugonna Ojiaku, and I am one 
        of the students of the UMN Twin Cities Coding Bootcamp. I am happy to be here! I 
        am enjoying my time and learning so far. I come from a family of four, and 
        I am the youngest child. I currently live in Brooklyn Park next to my sister and parents. 
        My brother lives in Atlanta, Georgia and my other sister lives in San Mateo, California. 
        Family means a lot to me! I am thankful to have them, as they inspire much of the 
        decisions I make in life. With that being said, my dad is a software engineer and 
        is ecstatic I'm in this program. Everyone has been supportive, but he is definitely 
        front runner. That is a little bit about me. Feel free to look at the rest of my site 
        and portfolio. I am still pretty new to web developing, but if you see anything you 
        like, please contact me. I would love to discuss ideas, projects and/or hot topics. 
        Happy browsing!
